# Breast-Cancer-Detection-using-Simple-FNN

Here I have built a model that detects breast cancer using a very simple feed forward neural network with the help of Keras.

The Dataset I used was a preincluded one in the sklearn datasets.

The python notebook shows a step by step approch in building the model.

# Simple Perceptron and Feed Forward NN using keras

Here I have built models for showing the simple implementations of a perceptron and a Feed Forward Neural Network

* For FFNN : I have a built a model that classifies the brest cancer detected as either begnin or malignent. The data used for this purpose is preincluded in the sklearn datasets.
* For perceptron : I have built a model with just a single neuron that mimics an AND gate. 

The python notebook shows a step by step approch in building both the model.
